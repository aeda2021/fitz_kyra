# INTRODUCTION
# American Foulbrood (AFB) is an infectious disease affecting the larval stage of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and is the most 
#widespread and destructive of the brood diseases. The causative agent is Paenibacillus larvae and the spore forming bacterium infects 
#queen, drone, and worker larvae. Only the spore stage of the bacterium is infectious to honey bee larvae. 
#The spores germinate into the vegetative stage soon after they enter the larval gut and continue to multiply until larval death. 
#The spores are extremely infective and resilient, and one dead larva may contain billions of spores. 

# Although adult bees are not directly affected by AFB, some of the tasks carried out by workers might have an 
#impact on the transmission of AFB spores within the colony and on the transmission of spores between colonies. 
#When a bee hatches from its cell, its first task is to clean the surrounding cells, and its next task is tending and 
#feeding of larvae. Here, the risk of transmitting AFB spores is particularly great if larvae that succumbed to AFB are cleaned prior to feeding susceptible larvae. 

# Because AFB is extremely contagious, hard to cure, and lethal at the colony level, it is of importance to detect outbreaks, before they spread and become difficult to control. Reliable detection methods are also important for studies of pathogen transmission within and between colonies. Of the available methods, sampling adult bees has been shown the most effective. Hornitzky and Karlovskis (1989) introduced the method of culturing adult honey bees for AFB, and demonstrated that spores can be detected from colonies without clinical symptoms. Recently, culturing of P. larvae from adult honey bee samples has been shown to be a more sensitive tool for AFB screening compared to culturing of honey samples. When samples of adult bees are used, the detection level of P. larvae is closely linked to the distribution of spores among the bees. 

# For this reason, we will model the density of P. larvae with the potential explanatory variables as number of bees in the hive, presence or absence of AFB, and hive identity.


# Read in and examine bee data
# Spobee column has density of P. larvae spores (the bacterium). 
# Hive has the ID of the hive sampled (there are 3 samples/hive)
# Infection has a metric quantifying the degree of infection. We will turn this into yes/no whether infection is present. 
Bees <- read.table(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aeda2021/2021_master/main/data/Bees.txt'), header=TRUE)
head(Bees)

Bees <- read.table("Bees.txt", header=TRUE)

# make hive a factor
Bees$fhive <- factor(Bees$Hive)

# Make a yes/no infection column (Infection01)
Bees$Infection01 <- Bees$Infection
Bees$Infection01[Bees$Infection01 > 0] <- 1
Bees$fInfection01 <- factor(Bees$Infection01) # turn this into a factor

# Scale BeesN to improve model convergence (mean 0, standard deviation 1)
Bees$sBeesN <- scale(Bees$BeesN)


# Make a Cleveland dot-chart of spores vs. hive
dotchart(Bees$Spobee, groups = Bees$fhive, xlab='Spores', ylab='Hive ID')  #saved as "6_SporesHive.jpeg"


# Q1. Does variance of spore density appear homogenous among hives? Why or why not?
#No, most hives have 0 spores, while hives 12-14 have spore densities above 50,000. Homogenous variance would mean spore densities
# are closer together.


# Q2. Try some transformations of the response variable to homogenize the variances (or at least improve it). 
#Which transformation of spore density seems reasonable? Why?

spobee_log <- log(Bees$Spobee + 1)
dotchart(spobee_log, groups = Bees$fhive, xlab='Spores', ylab='Hive ID')

spobee_sqrt <- sqrt(Bees$Spobee)
dotchart(spobee_sqrt, groups = Bees$fhive, xlab='Spores', ylab='Hive ID')

#The log transformation looks appropriate, as it transforms spore density to be on a scale of 1-12, and the variances look more 
#homogenous across hives. Log transformations can work with count data, which makes sense here.

# Q3. Develop a simple linear model for transformed spore density. Include infection (fInfection01), number of bees (sBeesN) 
#and their interaction as explanatory variables. Check for a hive effect by plotting standardized residuals 
#(see the residuals(yourmodel, type='pearson') function) against hive ID (fhive). Show your code and your plots. 
#Do residuals look homogenous among hives?

fInfection01 <- Bees$fInfection01
sBeesN <- Bees$sBeesN
Spobee <- Bees$Spobee

mod_simple <- lm(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + sBeesN*fInfection01, data=Bees) #error using the log transformed data

mod_simple_resid <- residuals(mod_simple, type='pearson')
plot(Bees$fhive, mod_simple_resid)   #saved as "6_SimpleModResiduals.jpeg" 
summary(mod_simple)

#The resiudals do not look homogenous among hives, indicating this is not a good model for our data.


# Q4. What are the advantages of including hive as a random effect, rather than as a fixed effect?

#We aren't concerned about looking at hives on an individual basis to evaluate our questions, making it appropriate as 
#a random effect. We will also have more degrees of freedom left available if we use hive as a random effect rather than 
#a fixed effect.

# Apply the Zuur protocol (10-step version outlined here, as used with the barn owl nesting data in Zuur Ch. 5):
# Step 1: Fit and check a "beyond optimal" linear regression (already done above)
# Step 2: Fit a generalized least squares version of the "beyond optimal" model (no need: we will use the linear regression model).

# Q5. Step 3. Choose a variance structure or structures (the random effects). What random effects do you want to try?

#Try hive as a random effect to start.

# We will now fit a mixed effects (ME) model. Zuur et al. used the nlme package in R, but Douglas Bates now has a newer package that is 
#widely used and that is called lme4. The benefits of lme4 include greater flexibility in the structure of the random effects, 
#the option to use non-Gaussian error structures (for generalized linear mixed effects models, or GLMMs), and more efficient code to 
#fit models. The main difference between nlme's lme() function and the lmer() function in lme4 is in how random effects are specified:
# model <- lmer(response ~ explanantoryvars + (1|random), data=mydata) # a random intercept model
# model <- lmer(response ~ explanantoryvars + (slope|random), data=mydata) # a random intercept and slope model
# One of the frustrations some people run into is that the lme4 package doesn't provide p-values. 
#This stems from disagreements and uncertainty about how best to calculate p-values. 
#However, if p-values are important to you, approximate p-values can be derived from the lmerTest package

# install.packages('lme4') # if needed
# install.packages('lmerTest') if needed
require(lmerTest)

# Q6. Step 4. Fit the "beyond optimal" ME model(s) with lmer() in the lme4 package 
#(transformed spore density is response, fInfection01, sBeesN, and interaction are the explanatory variables). Show your code.

fhive <- Bees$fhive

mod_me1 <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + sBeesN*fInfection01 + (1|fhive), data=Bees)  #random intercept

mod_me2 <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + sBeesN*fInfection01 + (sBeesN|fhive), data=Bees) #random slope and intercept
    

# Q7. Step 5. Compare the linear regression and ME model(s) with a likelihood ratio test, including correction for testing 
#on the boundary if needed. Use the anova() command. This will re-fit your lmer model with maximum likelihood, but this is OK 
#(note there are some debates about exactly how to best compare an lm and lmer model). Show your work and the results. 
#Which random effect structure do you choose based on the results?

anova(mod_me1, mod_me2, mod_simple)

#Simple LM AIC: 325.73
#Random Intercept (mod_me1) AIC: 253.43
#Random Slope and Intercept (mod_me2) AIC: 254.50

#I choose the Random Intercept model as it has the lowest AIC.

# Q8. Step 6. Check the model: plot standardized residuals vs. fitted values and vs. each predictor. 
#(You can get standardized residuals with residuals(yourmodel, type='pearson')). How do they look?

mod_me1_resid <- residuals(mod_me1, type='pearson')

plot(sBeesN, mod_me1_resid)                  #Saved as "6_FullModBeesResiduals.jpeg"


# Q9. Step 7. Re-fit the full model with ML (set REML=FALSE) and compare against a reduced model without the interaction term, 
#also fit with ML. Use anova() to compare the models. Which model do you choose? Why?

mod_me1_ml <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + sBeesN*fInfection01 + (1|fhive), data=Bees, REML=FALSE)  
#random intercept

mod_mered_ml <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + (1|fhive), data=Bees, REML=FALSE) 

anova(mod_me1_ml, mod_mered_ml)

#The reduced model has a better fit, as it has a lower AIC than the model with the interaction term.


# Q10. Step 8. Iterate #7 to arrive at the final model. Show your work. What is your final set of fixed effects?

mod_mered2_ml <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + (1|fhive), data=Bees, REML=FALSE)

mod_mered3_ml <- lmer(spobee_log ~ sBeesN + (1|fhive), data=Bees, REML=FALSE) 

anova(mod_me1_ml, mod_mered_ml, mod_mered2_ml, mod_mered3_ml)

#The reduced model with fInfection01 and sBeesN as fixed effects, but no interaction term is the best model, as it has the 
#lowest AIC.
#Best model: mod_mered_ml <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + (1|fhive), data=Bees, REML=FALSE) 

# Q11. Step 9. Fit the final model with REML. Check assumptions by plotting a histogram of residuals, 
#plotting Pearson standardized residuals vs. fitted values, and plotting Pearson standardized residuals vs. explanatory variables. 
#Are there issues with the model? If so, how might you address them?

mod_final <- lmer(spobee_log ~ fInfection01 + sBeesN + (1|fhive), data=Bees, REML=TRUE)

mod_final_resid <- residuals(mod_final, type='pearson')

hist(mod_final_resid)                            #Saved as "6_FinalModResidualsHist.jpeg"
plot(fitted.values(mod_final), mod_final_resid)  #Saved as "6_FinalModFittedValuesResiduals.jpeg"
plot(fInfection01, mod_final_resid, xlab="fInfection01", ylab="Residuals")  #Saved as "6_FinalModInfectionResiduals.jpeg"
plot(sBeesN, mod_final_resid)                    #Saved as "6_FinalModBeesResiduals.jpeg"

#The residuals appear appropriately distributed.

# Q12. Step 10. Interpret the model. The summary() command is useful here. What have you learned about American Foulbrood? 

summary(mod_final)

#The model tells us that when infection is present, the log of the bacterium spore density increases by 6. It also tells us that 
#the density of bees is multiplied by a factor of -0.7778, meaning that as the number of bees increases, the log of the bacterium spore 
#density will decrease at a rate of -0.7778. In summary, hives infected with American Foulbroud will have a higher density of spores
#than hives not infected, and hives with lower numbers of bees will have higher densities of P. larvae spores than hives with 
#higher numbers of bees. 

# Q13. Calculate the correlation between observations from the same hive as 
#variance(fhive random effect)/(variance(fhive random effect) + variance(residual)). Given the correlation among observations from 
#the same hive, do you think it's a good use of time to sample each hive multiple times? Why or why not?

4.8222/(4.8222 + 0.6033)  #correlation= 0.889

#As the correlation among observations from the same hive is very high and close to 1, I don't think it's a good use of time to 
#sample each hive multiple times. The results from sampling the same hive multiple times are likely to be very similar with this
#high of a correlation, so our time is best spent elsewhere.
